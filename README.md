# To Do list

Hi! 👋 This is a personal project that I worked on to practice Angular. 

It is a to do list application with the Angular framework and Bootstrap. 📋

Below is the link to view the code and web version on stackblitz. 🔗

Some of the features are 
 ⭐️ adding task to list, 
 ⭐️ marking task as completed(which will add it to a compeleted list), 
 ⭐️ deleting task, abilitiy to clear all current tasks, 
 ⭐️ ability to clear all completed tasks, 
 ⭐️ does not let you add task if there is no value in the input field.
