# To Do list

Personal Project: 

Hi! This is a personal project that I worked on to practice Angular. It is a to do list application with the Angular framework and Bootstrap. Below is the link to view the code and web version on stackblitz. 

Some of the features are 
 - adding task to list, 
 - marking task as completed(which will add it to a compeleted list), 
 - deleting task, abilitiy to clear all current tasks, 
 - ability to clear all completed tasks, 
 - does not let you add task if there is no value in the input field.
